## Branding

HR Connect uses its own identity, **not** the NEXT.io dark-grey house style:

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hrc-green` | `#245b3c` | Primary — headings, buttons |
| `hrc-green-deep` | `#1b2d21` | Dark section bands |
| `hrc-green-mid` | `#2f7a4f` | Hover states |
| `hrc-amber` | `#ffce33` | Accent — eyebrows, marks, highlights |
| `hrc-cream` / `hrc-sand` | `#fffdf6` / `#f6f3e9` | Page backgrounds |

Colours were sampled directly from the official HR Connect infographic. Type is
Plus Jakarta Sans.

Brand assets in `public/logos/`:

- `hrconnect-lockup-{green,amber,white}.svg` — the `HRconnect · NEXT.io | GAMING MALTA`
  lockup, one file per colourway (an `<img>`-loaded SVG cannot inherit `currentColor`,
  so the colour is baked in).
- `hrconnect-mark.svg` / the inline `<Mark>` component — the four-piece brand mark,
  traced from the infographic. Inline, so it *does* follow `currentColor`.
- `members/*.png` — 27 member logos, background-removed and quantised.

## Source material

Content comes from the **HR Connect 2027 project deck** (Stage 0 Definition and
Stage 1 Products & Financials) and the public **HR Connect infographic**.

## Internal-only material — do not publish

The project deck contains commercial information that must **not** appear on this
site. Keep it out of any future change:

- Revenue, cost of sales, commission rate, profit targets and cashflow projections
- Per-member fee breakdowns (which company pays what)
- Churn rates, member-count targets and internal KPI tables
- Team responsibilities and named internal owners
- Sales mechanics (the light-membership deal add-on, September Drive, HubSpot campaigns)
- The internal OneDrive project folder link

Published proof points are limited to member satisfaction, LinkedIn reach, the
public member wall and the published fee bands.
